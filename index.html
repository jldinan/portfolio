The main dashboard among other things allows for the content on remote screens to be managed via scheduling, new content to be uploaded/created, and playlists to be constructed. The project is now worked on by an additional 3 junior developers who I mentor and have contributed significantly in adding more features and improvements to the application.',

The plugin is a modular part to the application and I created the DevOps process that allows this to be deployed to sports customers. In this dashboard you can see the navigable tree of sports data on the left hand panel. This data can be assigned by context menu scheduling or dragging to groups of displays. A page is selected that is tagged to fit that data type - here a page built using React. Behind the dialog is a live preview of the content (which I had previously assigned) that you can view from the group menu.',

I have also been responsible for developing other forms for managing other parts of the UI, such as users, permissions and displays.

The user can drag, position, rotate them, and set various styling and other properties.

Using the textbox overlays allows non design team individuals to change text content of a design easily.

There are custom business rules for formatting data, the display of "Due off", "Race Off", "Race Late" banners and countdown timers, and custom animations for the display of some of these elements. The whole page changes layout based on the number of runners in the race, or the type or race (horses/dogs).

The QR code widget URL is dynamically set based on the data and was an idea I suggested to the customer. This allows it to point directly to the Grosvenor website page for the matching race and allows the customer to quickly and easily take their bets.

As part of the sports module development, I was also responsible for developing the mechanism for how data is delivered to the displays. I created a JSON Patch service using Node.js that sends out updates. The client stores its own local copy in IndexedDb and then is able to apply its own updates to its local source. It utilises checksums to ensure the data is always consistent and if not resyncs using an API request.

A playlist can be built by setting options such as sport, time period to cover etc.. and the playlist will be dynamically built as new data is added and removed from the system.
