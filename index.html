Designed architecture of frontend SPA, and built the core components and majority of functionality seen here. This main dashboard is for a customer called Places Leisure - a chain of Gyms/Leisure centers. The main dashboard among other things allows for the content on remote screens to be managed via scheduling, new content to be uploaded/created, and playlists to be constructed. The project is now worked on by an additional 3 junior developers who I mentor and have contributed significatly in adding more features and improvements to the application. ',

There are several other parts to the application, ranging from managing connected display hardware, users, roles and permissions, plugins, settings and anayltics data. I have been involved in the creation and development work on much of these other application areas, or have mentored and helped Junior developrs in tackling these parts.',

The image here shows the current v2 UI which reuses the same backend logic but has been reimplemented and improved by mself and the rest of the team in the frontend. The plugin is a modular part to the application and I created the DevOps process that allows this to be deployed to sports customers. In this dashboard you can see the navigable tree of sports data on the left hand panel. This data can be assigned by context menu scheduling or dragging to groups of displays. A page is selected that is tagged to fit that data type - here a page built using React. Behind the dialog is a live preview of the content (which I had previously assigned) that you can view from the group menu.',

I have also been responsible for developing other forms for managing other parts of the UI, such as users, permissions and displays.

The user can drag, position, rotate them, and set various styling and other properties. Here for instance it is showing the QR code widget that can be set to a URL and overlayed on top of existing designs. The editor has widgets for tables, slideshows, date and time, webpages, social media, and data that I was responsible for creating, all as custom components.

Whilst the editor is primarily useful for customers to overlay and position dynamic elements such as QR codes, data, date and time, social media etc.. onto their existing designs perhaps designed in other software (Canva, Photoshop etc..), it has also been useful for certain customers to be able to create their own designs directly in the editor. Using the textbox overlays allows non design team indviduals to change text content of a design easily. Page designs can also be stored as templates so it is quick and easy to create news pages following a theme.  ',

There are custom buisness rules for formatting data, the display of "Due off", "Race Off", "Race Late" banners and countdown timers, and custom animations for the display of some of these elements. The whole page changes layout based on the number of runners in the race, or teh type or race (horses/dogs).

Here it shows additional star ratings, which I built custom reusable components for, and also the QR code widget. The QR code widget URL is dynamically set based on the data and was an idea I suggested to the customer. This allows it to point directly to the grosvenors website page for the matching race and allows the customer to quickly and easily take their bets. At the time the casino was not allowed to take sports bets in venue so this made the process more streamlined and something they were excited to incorporate. ',

As part of the sports module development, I was also responsible for devloping the mechanicm for how data is delivered to the displays. I created a JSON Patch service using Node.js that sends out updates. The client stores its own local copy in IndexedDb and then is able to apply its own updates to its local source. It utilises checksums to ensure the data is always consistent and if not resyncs usign an API request.
